## What is Network Security?

**Network security** is a set of policies, configurations, and practices designed to protect the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of data within a network.

Every time you connect to the Internet — at home, at work, or on a mobile device — you're using a network that can be vulnerable if not properly secured.

## Key Concepts You Should Know

### 🔒 Firewall

A **firewall** is a barrier that filters incoming and outgoing network traffic. It can be hardware- or software-based, and its main purpose is to **block unauthorized access** while allowing legitimate connections.

> Example: blocking port 23 (Telnet) to prevent attacks on outdated services.

---

### 🌐 VPN (Virtual Private Network)

A **VPN** encrypts your network traffic and routes it through a secure server, masking your real IP address and protecting your data on untrusted networks.

> ✅ Perfect for public Wi-Fi, like in coffee shops or airports.

---

### 📊 IDS / IPS

- **IDS (Intrusion Detection System):** detects suspicious activity on the network.
- **IPS (Intrusion Prevention System):** not only detects, but **blocks** threats automatically.

> Popular tools: Snort, Suricata.

### 🔐 Network Encryption

**Encryption** ensures that data can only be read by those with the correct key. It applies to both internal communications and external services (such as HTTPS).

> Think of encryption as a lock that only you and the recipient can open.

## Basic Best Practices to Secure Your Network

- Change default router and device passwords.
- Keep firmware and software up to date.
- Use WPA2 or WPA3 encryption on Wi-Fi networks.
- Set up a separate guest network.
- Regularly check which devices are connected.

Network security isn’t just for experts or large organizations. Even a home network can be targeted if not properly protected.  
**Understanding these concepts empowers you to make safer decisions and protect your digital environment.**
